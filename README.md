# Yoga_Pose_Detection_And_Prediction
# Overview
The Yoga Pose Detector is a deep learning-based project designed to analyze and classify yoga poses from images or video frames. By combining state-of-the-art object detection and image classification techniques, the project aims to assist users in identifying yoga poses accurately, which can be beneficial for fitness tracking, instructional purposes, or automated yoga tutorials.

# Features
Pose Detection: Real-time detection of yoga poses using advanced algorithms.<br>
Object Detection with YOLO: Identifies key body regions to focus on relevant parts of the pose.<br>
Pose Classification with VGG16: Utilizes transfer learning for accurate pose recognition.<br>
Image Processing: Preprocesses input images for optimal model performance.<br>
Visualization: Highlights detected poses and displays results for easy interpretation.

# Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python<br>
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras <br>
Computer Vision Tools: OpenCV, YOLO<br>
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn<br>

# Workflow

# 1. Input Handling:
Accepts images or video frames for processing.

# 2. Pose Detection (YOLO):
Detects body parts or the entire pose region.
Outputs bounding boxes or key regions of interest.

# 3. Feature Extraction (VGG16):
Processes detected regions for feature extraction.
Classifies poses using a fine-tuned model.

# 4. Visualization:
Displays results with bounding boxes and pose labels.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
Libraries:
tensorflow, keras, opencv-python, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, cvzone, ultralytics
GPU for faster model inference (optional but recommended)

# Installation
1. Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/yoga-pose-detector.git
cd yoga-pose-detector
2. Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
